# Music-Moo
Gets rid of Spotify by downloading music from Youtube and putting it on Google Drive

1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Perform Step 1 from [this quickstart](https://developers.google.com/drive/v3/web/quickstart/python)
3. Create a folder in your Google Drive called `Music`
4. Put Youtube link in the `download` function
5. Run `python moo.py` and allow Google Drive access (only do this one as it creates the `credentials.json` file)
6. Download a cloud music player to connect to your Google Drive and play music on your devices

This is a WIP at the moment
